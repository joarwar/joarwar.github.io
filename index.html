										<h2>About me</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/joarcv.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I'm a curious, easy to learn, solution-focused and creative person. Programming is something that I find very entertaining and extremely appealing. As an employee and colleague, I have been highly appreciated and work very well both independently and in a team and have very good collaboration skills. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, various types of exercise and spending time with my friends. My goal after completing my education is to be able to help different types of companies, large and small, by being a link between the company's ideas and helping them to realize these in programming.</p>
